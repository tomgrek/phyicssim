# PhysBox Studio

A browser-based rigid-body physics simulator and CAD fabrication studio powered by MuJoCo WASM, CSG boolean modeling, and WebSerial hardware control. Build, simulate, analyze, and export physical mechanisms in real time.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **MuJoCo WASM Physics Engine** — Full contact dynamics, multi-axis joints, motor actuators, proximity mechanical constraints (gears, pinion-rack, pulley ropes, welds).
* **3D CSG Parametric Modeling** — Manifold boolean operations (Union, Subtract, Intersect) and OpenSCAD web worker integration.
* **Interactive 3D Mouse Spring Dragging** — Click and drag live objects in the 3D viewport during playback with real-time spring force lines.
* **Fabrication Exporters**:
  * **3D Print STL Exporter** — Binary `.stl` export centered and Z-up oriented for OrcaSlicer / PrusaSlicer.
  * **3D Printability & Structural HUD** — Overhang visualizer, thin-wall alert, layer orientation stress visualizer, print time & filament cost estimator.
  * **2D Laser Cut / CNC Exporter** — 3D-to-2D panel layout, finger/mortise-tenon joints, kerf compensation, dogbone reliefs, SVG & G-code output.
  * **Contour Slicing Exporter** — Stackable relief contour slicing for laser/cardboard/foam, exporting SVG, G-code, and ZIP packages.
  * **Relief Carve Exporter** — Heightmap roughing/finishing toolpaths with probed mesh levelling.
* **Machine Control & Work Origin** — Jog pad (0.1/1/10 mm steps) to drive the tool to the job origin, `G10 L20` XY zeroing, touch-plate Z probing that refuses to set a datum when the probe never makes contact, and 3×3+ bed probing that warps G-code to follow an untrue bed. GRBL 1.1 / FluidNC / grblHAL over WebSerial. See **Docs → Fabrication → Machine Setup &amp; Zeroing** in the app.
* **Hardware Primitives** — Heat-set insert bosses (M2–M8), metric printed threads (M3–M16), hex nut traps (M3–M6), bearing pockets, snap-fits, D-shaft motor couplers.
* **AI Copilot & MCP Bridge** — In-app AI agent panel and WebSocket MCP server bridge (`physbox_mcp`) for external agent scene generation.

## 📈 Simulation Telemetry

The physics worker keeps a rolling history of the simulation state, sampled every
10 steps and capped in length, readable from the app or by an external agent over
MCP (`physics_get_telemetry` for the latest sample, `physics_get_history` for the
buffer, `physics_run_headless` for a trajectory with no viewport at all):

* **Per-body** — world position, linear velocity, angular velocity, and the applied 6-DOF force/torque (`xfrc_applied`).
* **Per-joint** — articulation angle (`qpos`), rate (`qvel`), and applied force (`qfrc_applied`).
* **Contacts** — the active contact set as MuJoCo resolves it each step.

The bottom status bar carries the scene and machine readouts: component, geom and
vertex counts on the left; machine target, stock material, connection status and
live job progress on the right.

## 🔮 Coming Soon

* **TeknoBox Control Over Objects** — Direct physical device control and hardware manipulation over simulated objects via built-in Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) motion sensors.
* **Telemetry Graphing** — Plotting the buffer above as live curves in the app: energy balance, per-body kinematics, and actuator control signals. The data is recorded today; nothing draws it yet. (Signals from real hardware belong in Volt, where a scope node wired to a Heltec pin already plots them live.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # dev server on port 5175
```

Open [http://localhost:5175](http://localhost:5175).

### Connecting AI Agents via MCP

```bash
cd ~/physbox_mcp
venv/bin/python server.py --stdio   # stdio mode for Claude Code
# or
venv/bin/python server.py           # HTTP on port 3141
```

Open the app with `?mcpPort=3142` appended to the URL: `http://localhost:5175?mcpPort=3142`.

## 📐 Coordinate System

MuJoCo is **Z-up**: X=right, Y=forward (into screen), Z=up. Ground plane at Z=0.

Static mesh `vertices` are authored in **Three.js Y-up** space (X=right, Y=up, Z=toward camera). The MJCF compiler swaps Y↔Z automatically.

See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) for full mesh authoring workflow.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

Deployed as a static build behind nginx, in the same shape as the other Physbox apps:

```bash
docker build --build-arg GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) -t physbox-mesh .
docker run -p 8080:8080 physbox-mesh
```

### GitHub Packages dependency (`@physbox-io/ui`)

Mesh depends on the shared `@physbox-io/ui` design-token package, published to
GitHub Packages rather than the public npm registry (see `.npmrc`). This means
`npm install` — both locally and inside the Docker build — needs a GitHub token
with the `read:packages` scope:

* **Locally**: `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s read:packages`, then
  `export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)` before `npm install` or `docker build`.
* **In the Dockerfile**: the `builder` stage declares `ARG GITHUB_TOKEN` and
  copies it into `ENV GITHUB_TOKEN` so `.npmrc`'s `${GITHUB_TOKEN}`
  interpolation can find it during `RUN npm install`. It's a build arg, not
  baked into the final `nginx` stage, so it never ends up in the shipped image.

### Cloud Run deploy (Cloud Build trigger, not checked into this repo)

Pushes to `main` deploy automatically via the `physbox-deploy` Cloud Build
trigger (service `phyicssim`, region `us-west1`; see internal infra notes for
the GCP project). This trigger's build steps are **not** a `cloudbuild.yaml`
in this repo — they were auto-generated by GCP's "Deploy to Cloud Run" flow
and live only in the trigger config. To view or edit them:

```bash
gcloud builds triggers describe physbox-deploy --project=<gcp-project-id>
gcloud builds triggers import --source=<edited-file>.yaml --project=<gcp-project-id>
```

The build step passes `GITHUB_TOKEN` into `docker build --build-arg` from a
Secret Manager secret (`github-packages-token`, a classic GitHub PAT scoped
to `read:packages`, shared with Etch's and Volt's equivalent triggers), via
the trigger's `availableSecrets`/`secretEnv`. Because Cloud Build's `docker`
step args are NOT shell-expanded by default, the step invokes `docker build`
through `sh -c "..."` so `$$GITHUB_TOKEN` actually expands to the secret's
value — passing it as a literal step arg silently sends the string
`$GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of the token. The build also passes
`--network=cloudbuild` to `docker build`.

To rotate the token: create a new classic PAT with `read:packages` scope,
then `gcloud secrets versions add github-packages-token
--project=<gcp-project-id> --data-file=-` (paste the token, Ctrl-D). The
Cloud Build service account already has `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`
on this secret.
