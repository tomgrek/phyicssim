 * drifted: the laser offered to re-zero Z at a tool change, the contour modal
 * did not, and none of the three had a way to pause a job that was simply
 * cutting too deep in a place the operator had just noticed. The only choices
 * were to watch it finish or to hit E-Stop, which on a relief that has been
 * running for two hours means the piece is scrap, because a soft reset loses the
 * position and the carve cannot be re-registered.

 * direction that drives the new bit into the work. Nothing on the controller
 * knows that has happened, so the button that would send it back into the cut
 * stays shut until one of the two zeroing routes has run, or until the operator

/**
 * How far through the job is, in the panel the operator is already looking at.
 *
 * All of this existed already — it is in the status bar along the bottom of the
 * window — and none of it could be seen while a carve was running, because the
 * export modal that starts the job is a `fixed inset-0 z-50` overlay and the
 * status bar underneath it is `z-20`. Pressing Start put a blurred sheet over
 * the only progress readout in the app for the whole of a four-hour cut, and
 * `JobPreflight` deliberately blanks itself mid-job on the assumption that
 * something else is showing this. Nothing was.
 *
 * Time rather than lines is the headline for the same reason the status bar
 * leads with it: G-code lines are not evenly sized in time, so "line 4,000 of
 * 7,000" is not 57% of the wait. The line count is still here, labelled as what
 * it is — where in the file the streamer has got to, which is the number worth
 * quoting when something has gone wrong.

 * and a reset, and nothing in between. The percentage shown is the controller's
 * own `Ov:` report rather than a tally of what was clicked — an override
 * survives a reload, is cleared by a reset, and may be changed from a pendant,
 * and a readout that remembered its own clicks would be wrong after any of
 * those.
 *
 * These are real-time bytes, so they are acted on immediately rather than
 * queueing behind the thousands of lines already sent. That is the whole point:
 * the buffered lines are exactly what needs slowing down.
