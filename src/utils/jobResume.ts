// Picking a job back up where it stopped
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Everything that ends a job early ends it in the same place: line eleven
// thousand of nineteen thousand, three hours in. A bit snaps, a limit switch
// twitches, the USB cable is nudged, the power blinks. Up to now every one of
// those meant starting the carve again from the top — recutting three hours of
// air and finished surface to get back to the point where it stopped, which on
// a relief is not merely slow but actively damaging.
//
// A G-code program cannot simply be entered in the middle, because almost
// nothing in it is self-contained. Line eleven thousand is `G1 X84.2 Y19.7` and
// it means nothing on its own: the units, the absolute-versus-incremental mode,
// the work coordinate system, the feedrate, the spindle speed and the Z the
// tool is supposed to be at were all set hundreds or thousands of lines earlier
// and have been in force ever since. Sending that line to a machine sitting at
// its home position with the spindle off does something arbitrary and probably
// expensive.
//
// So resuming means replaying: read the program from the top *without sending
// it*, accumulating the state each line would have left behind, and then write
// a short preamble that puts the machine back into that state before the stream
// restarts. That is what this file does. It sends nothing and talks to nothing
// — it turns a program and a line number into the lines that have to come
// first, which makes the interesting part of resuming something that can be
// tested rather than discovered on a ruined workpiece.
