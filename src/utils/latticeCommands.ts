// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Lattice modelling without a pointer
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The viewport resolves a click into a grid coordinate by raycasting a dot
// field; a caller arriving over MCP has no pointer, no camera and no dots. What
// it has instead is better: this mode's whole state is integers on a grid, so a
// position can simply be SAID.
//
// That is the one place lattice modelling is easier to drive blind than
// sculpting is. A sculpt request has to be snapped to a surface whose shape the
// caller cannot see, and a coordinate guessed from a bounding box is usually
// thin air — hence physics_probe_sculpt. Here, "the corner at 20, -10, 0" is
// exactly a corner, it is the same corner on the next call, and reading the
// model back gives coordinates that can be fed straight in again.
//
// Callers speak MILLIMETRES in the body's own frame, not grid steps: millimetres
// are what a part is specified in, and the grid is 0.1 mm, so every tenth of a
// millimetre is exactly representable and nothing is lost in the conversion.
//
// Everything here is a pure function of a cage and a request. The bridge does
// the store work; this does the geometry, and can be tested without a viewport.
