// The laser exporter unwraps flat faces onto sheet stock; the contour exporter
// stacks the model out of horizontal slices. This one carves the model into the
// face of a solid block, the way a relief plaque is carved: the scene is
// sampled from directly above into a heightmap, that heightmap is squashed into
// the depth the user is willing to cut, and a ball-nose, flat or V cutter
// sweeps it in parallel passes.
//
// The pipeline is: tessellate the scene into world triangles, fit them onto the
// stock, drop a ray down through every grid cell to get the surface height,
// dilate that surface by the cutter's own shape so the tool sits ON the surface
// instead of THROUGH it, then emit an optional layered roughing pass followed by
// the finishing raster.
//
// Everything in here is millimetres in machine coordinates, with the top face of
// the stock at Z = 0 and cuts running negative.
